This repository shows us the code to create an application that analyzes the tweets of a certain hashtag or a word and returns us the percentage of positive, neutral and negative tweets in a pie chart. Besides that, it returns us a .CSV file with the analyzed tweets. Finally the code is automated to send the results via SMTP. In this case using the gmail service.
